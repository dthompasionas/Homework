# Horiseon-repair

This was a code refactor on the Horiseon home page in order to make sure
all code was up to accessability standards.

	Job task:
-GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

-WHEN I view the source code

-THEN I find semantic HTML elements

-WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

-THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

-WHEN I view the image elements

-THEN I find accessible alt attributes

-WHEN I view the heading attributes

-THEN they fall in sequential order

-WHEN I view the title element

-THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

	Task completed:
-Replaced HTML tags with semantic HTML tags

-Added "Alt" text to all images

-Provided comments and indicators on the HTML and CSS

-Reorganized 

-Added a title
